where would i impliment a 2d array into this program 
    fano plane best for 2d array
    2d array of char of questions 
*would i need to preform a linear search to find the lies 
     where are 0 and where are 1 (2methods for each usign arrayList)
Do i need to replace the lies with truths(1,0).
    replace it with truth
   
How to find the lie
    1.find positions of 1's in arrray 
    2.have both positions in (x1,y1) form
    3. find slope [m=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)]
    
    projective geo 

    position will be sent to the 2d fanoplane where it will be assigned the position of the lie within the array(1-7)
    (row,colum)
